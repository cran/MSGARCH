#' The R package MSGARCH
#'@description The \R package \code{MSGARCH} aims to provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for
#' Markov-switching GARCH processes (Haas et al. 2004), including fitting, filtering, forecasting, and simulating.
#' Other functions related to  Value-at-Risk, Expected-Shortfall, and conditional distributions
#' are also available. The main functions of the package are coded in \code{C++} with \code{Rcpp} (Eddelbuettel and Francois, 2011) 
#' and \code{RcppArmadillo} (Eddelbuettel and Sanderson, 2014).
#' In the \R package \code{MSGARCH} there is no equation for the mean as in the \R package \code{rugarch} (Ghalanos, 2015). 
#' This means that we assume that before modeling, the user has filtered the mean from their time series.
#' \cr We provide a variety of single-regime GARCH processes and regime-switching allowing for many conditional distributions. 
#' This allows for a rich modeling environment for Markov-switching GARCH models. Each single-regime process is a one-lag process (e.g., GARCH(1,1)).
#' Allowing for only one-lag has proved to be sufficient in many cases and it reduces models complexity which can become a problem during the optimization procedure. 
#' When optimization is taking place, we ensure that each regime is covariance-stationary and strictly positive (see details in \code{\link{kernel}} for more information)
#'  which makes the entire process also covariance-stationary and strickly positive.
#'  We also set a condition that each unique single-regime models type in a multiple-regime framework are in order of unconditional volatility.
#'  This means that is if a three regimes specification with two \code{sGARCH} regimes and one \code{gjrGARCH} regime
#'  is constructed with \code{\link{create.spec}}, the first \code{sGARCH} regime will have a lower unconditional volatility than the second
#'  \code{sGARCH} regime while the \code{gjrGARCH} regime can have any unconditional volatility since it is the only regime with this model.
#'  For a full demonstration of the package please read \href{../doc/MSGARCH.pdf}{Markov-Switching GARCH Models in R: The MSGARCH Package}.
