\title{The R package MSGARCH}
\description{
The \R package \code{MSGARCH} aims to provide a comprehensive set of functionalities for
Markov-switching GARCH processes, including fitting, filtering, forecasting, and simulating.
Other functions related to  Value-at-Risk, Expected-Shortfall, and conditional distributions
are also available. The main functions of the package are coded in \code{C++} with \code{Rcpp} (Eddelbuettel and Francois, 2011) 
and \code{RcppArmadillo} (Eddelbuettel and Sanderson, 2014).
In the \R package \code{MSGARCH} there is no equation for the mean as in the \R package \code{rugarch} (Ghalanos, 2015). 
This means that we assume that before modeling, the user has filter the mean from their time series.
\cr We provide a variety of 
single-regime GARCH process and regime-switching process as well as many conditional distributions. 
This allows for a rich modeling environment for Markov-switching GARCH models. Each single-regime process in a one-lag process (e.g., GARCH(1,1)).
Allowing for only one-lag has proved to be sufficient in financial econometrics and it reduces models complexity which can become a problem during the optimization procedure. 
When optimization is taking place, we ensure that each regime is covariance-stationary and strictly positive (see details in \code{\link{kernel}} for more information)
 which makes the entire process also covariance-stationary and strickly positive.
 We also set a condition that each unique single-regime models type in a multiple-regime framework are in order of unconditional volatility.
 This means that is if a three regimes specification with two \code{sGARCH} regimes and one \code{gjrGARCH} regime
 is constructed with \code{\link{create.spec}}, the first \code{sGARCH} regime will have a lower unconditional volatility than the second
 \code{sGARCH} regime while the \code{gjrGARCH} regime can have any unconditional volatility since it is the only regime with this model.
